		<p>This site is a playground - somewhere I can toy around without pressure.</p>
		<p>I'm building it from scratch, without any plan or design, using it as an excuse to learn <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> in the process. There's not much here yet.</p>

			<p>In my free time I love to read, write, and shoot amateur photography. I play with the occasional Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi project, and get a kick out of traditional hand-tool woodwork.</p>
			<p>I'm lead developer at <a
	href="http://viewcreative.co.uk" target="_blank">View Creative Agency</a>. My job is to help make beautiful websites that perform well for both our clients and their audience.</p>
			<p>My role includes project assessment and planning; system and server management; building HTML, CSS, and JS powered front-ends; CMS integrations; and helping develop our team into a force to be reckoned with. It's rewarding and fun stuff.</p>
			<p>I've been a full-time web developer since 2004, and a keen hobbyist before that. I've been a member of the HTML Working Group and Responsive Images Community Group.</p>
