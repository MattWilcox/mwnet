				<h2>Professional information</h2>

				<p>I've been a full-time web developer since 2004, and a keen hobbyist before that. I've been a member of the HTML Working Group and Responsive Images Community Group.</p>

			<div class="callout">
				<p>Progressive Enhancement, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>/<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, and accessible practices will always be core to quality work.</p>

			</div>

				<p>I am currently <strong>lead web developer</strong> at <a href="https://viewcreative.co.uk">View Creative Agency</a>, where I have worked since 2008. My role has expanded a lot over the years, as I have taught myself new skills to match demands.</p>

				<h3>My day-to-day work may see me:</h3>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Build complete websites</strong>, from simple brochure sites to <strong>multi&#8209;lingual e&#8209;commerce projects</strong> using:

						<ul>
							<li>A <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack / Caddy stack</li>
							<li>Local, staging, and live server environments.</li>
							<li>GIT version control and GitHub deployments.</li>
							<li>
								The <strong><a href="https://craftcms.com">Craft CMS</a> ecosystem</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>DDEV (a Docker based local development system)</li>
									<li>TWIG templating</li>
									<li>Custom plugin development (PHP / Yii)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>SCSS / PCSS / CSS</li>
							<li>Modern JavaScript</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Adapting provided visuals to work well across various devices (Responsive, mobile-first).</li>
					<li>Adapting designs and code as needed for good <strong>accessibility</strong> practice. (WCAG, WAI, ARIA)</li>
					<li>Provision, monitor, and administer our fleet of <strong>Linux based web servers</strong>.</li>
					<li>Create and administer our <strong>Bash based build scripts</strong>, which allow the team to rapidly create and work on new web projects.</li>
					<li>Create and update our "starter project" to ensure using good <strong>best practices</strong> are how all our web projects begin.</li>
					<li>Creating "issues" and contributing to the ecosystem via GitHub third-party projects.</li>
					<li><strong>Assisting the team</strong> with their own projects as needed.</li>
					<li>Basic <strong>performance reviews and enhancements</strong> of team-members projects.</li>
					<li>Meeting and working with clients.</li>
					<li>Assessment and planning for potential new projects.</li>
					<li>Researching, testing, and implementing new web development techniques and ideas.</li>
					<li><strong>Collaborating</strong> with colleagues on how best to solve various problems.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I strongly believe in <strong>Web Standards</strong> and using the right tools for the right job. Most projects at <abbr title="View Creative Agency">VCA</abbr> lean heavily on traditional document-centric web technologies, for which the whole web stack was designed and optimised. These "traditional" approaches are often a highly performant and appropriate choice (especially when enhanced by some modern JavaScript). It's nice to see <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1388679463819366401">Google Chrome developers are echoing that viewpoint</a>.</p>

				<p>I have dabbled in Vue and Svelte, and not at all with React; but almost no project VCA have taken on has best suited a "<abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> / <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr>" style of development or deployment, though I'd look forward to that challenge should it arise.</p>

				<p>I have also worked for VCA and our clients as a <strong>photographer</strong> over a number of years, producing and editing shots for online and print projects including:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Lifestyle shoots</li>
					<li>Documentary style shoots</li>
					<li>Product shots in varying styles</li>
					<li>Portrait shots</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="callout">
				<p>I have an analytical mind, enjoy problem solving, and like to do things well. I get the most satisfaction from working on projects that have a clear and real benefit to wider society, and which you could call "a greater good". <strong>I'd like to leave the world a better place than I entered it</strong>, if I can.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="uc_rich-text">
				<p>NOTE: I do not currently maintain an archive of projects I have worked on, but the <a href="https://viewcreative.co.uk/work">VCA website</a> is a good place to look in general.</p>
