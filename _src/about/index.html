		<h1 class="uc_h2">Matt Wilcox</h1>
		<p>Is a middle aged white guy from the UK, trying to become less ignorant over time. I build websites the "traditional" way. Iâ€™ve been building them for ~20yrs.</p>
		<p>Progressive Enhancement, HTML/CSS/JS, and accessible practices will always be core to quality work. Frameworks come and go.</p>

			<p>In my free time I love to read, write, and shoot amateur photography. I play with the occasional Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi project, and get a kick out of traditional hand-tool woodwork.</p>
			<p>I'm lead developer at <a
	href="http://viewcreative.co.uk" target="_blank">View Creative Agency</a>. My job is to help make beautiful websites that perform well for both our clients and their audience.</p>
			<p>My role includes project assessment and planning; system and server management; building HTML, CSS, and JS powered front-ends; CMS integrations; and helping develop our team into a force to be reckoned with. It's rewarding and fun stuff.</p>
			<p>I've been a full-time web developer since 2004, and a keen hobbyist before that. I've been a member of the HTML Working Group and Responsive Images Community Group.</p>
