# Matt's personal site

This is the repo for my personal site.

It's a from-scratch build and intended as a place where I'm free to just *do things* without having to worry about all the sorts of factors you have to worry about when you're building client sites.

It's really early days, there's nothing really here yet. There's no schedule or deadline. There's no topic or design or agenda I have in mind. I am just "doing things in the open" because, that's how things used to be - and it used to be *fun* to just tool around like this.

If you're looking here, please understand that as of the start of 2024, here's the state of play:

- I'm using this as an excuse to learn [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), currently on `3.0 Alpha 4`.
- I'm also playing about with "2023+" ideas for organising and using very modern web platform features. Those ideas are still in a bit of flux. I, deliberately, don't care about backward compatibility etc here. That's part of the point.
- As of this moment, the site is not live anywhere either.
