# Matt's personal site

This is the repo for my personal site.

It's a from-scratch build and intended as a place where I'm free to just *do things* without having to worry about all the sorts of factors you have to worry about when you're building client sites.

It's really early days, there's nothing really here yet. There's no schedule or deadline. There's no topic or design or agenda I have in mind. I am just "doing things in the open" because, that's how things used to be - and it used to be *fun* to just tool around like this.
